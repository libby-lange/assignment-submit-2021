    "After reading the style guide, one idea that surprised me was how much of a conversation coding is. Having only written code in this class for assignments that will only be seen by 1-2 people, I had never considered it from that perspective. In fact, most of my comments to this point had been reminders to myself more than anything. I had definitely never thought about how comment readability or even language use should be a major consideration, although of course in hindsight this makes perfect sense. This also ties into the importance the use of whitespace is given in Python. I had always thought of the code itself as the most important feature of my code, but now I understand why Casey is so consistent in asking us to space out operands and add extra lines. I was also struck by the specificity of some of the style suggestions. My mental image of coders at work was admittedly formed by 'hackers' in movies, but I had always assumed speed reigns supreme when it comes to writing large code projects. Yet the style guide would beg to differ. For example, they prefer the use of four spaces to tabs, even though tabs are vastly more convenient (and also what I have been using). I found it unfortunate that the style guide has no recommendation for string quote usage, because this is the only stylistic area where I have a preference. Single quotation marks just look better! Fortunately, the Python style guide seems like a living document that is constantly being revisited and revised, so maybe there is hope yet.\n",

    "The style guide is very specific in pointing out that coders should respect the conventions of their organization if they are working on a self-contained project. How universal is the use of Pythonic best practices in the real world outside of the largest organizations?\n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed the article is authored by just a few of the major figures in Python. How much input does the Python community have into what coding best practices should be?"
